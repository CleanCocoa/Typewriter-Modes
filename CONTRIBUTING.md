You're very welcome to suggest, change, adapt, and replace anything you like in a pull request! If you want to propose a dramatic change, please open an issue first for discussion before making a pull request, though. Because discussions in PRs often get messy easily.

That being said, the usual guidelines apply:

* fork this repository, 
* commit changes to a new branch in your fork,
* create a pull request from your branch to this repository's `master`.
